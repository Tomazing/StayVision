Make the itinerary feel deeply personal and emotionally connected to the information they've shared.
Use minimal emojis - limit to at most one per day title, and avoid them in activity descriptions, tips and highlights.
Write descriptions with genuine enthusiasm and personality, using rich and evocative language instead of emojis.
Include family-friendly activities based on user preferences.
DO NOT include any explanatory text, ONLY output the JSON object.`;
